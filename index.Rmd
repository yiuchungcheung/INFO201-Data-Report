## Summary Information
Analyzing the 2018 Mass Shooting Data retrieved from <http://www.shootingtracker.com/>, a total of `r shootings_occured` shootings occured across the country in the given year, with a total of `r total_lives_lost` lives lost and `r total_injuries` injured. The city that was most impacted by mass shootings (by measuring the total number of deaths and injuries within the city) is `r city_most_impacted`, with `r num_city_most_impacted` reported victims (both dead or injured). The state with the most number of victims killed is `r state_most_num_killed`, with `r num_most_num_killed` victims reported dead. The state with the most number of victims wounded is `r state_most_num_injured`, with `r num_most_num_injured` victims reported injured.

## Description of a Particular Incident


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, echo=FALSE}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
